This threat grows even more significant in regions where magic runs rampant or where portals to the realm of Nyx exist, as unrestrained magical energy often causes more chimeras to appear in a region.

When Renata slayed this lion-ram-dragon creation effortlessly, Keranos created another combination of deadlier beasts to challenge her. She slayed that beast, too.

As a result, a hungry chimera might appear out of a clear sky to pick off prey nearly anywhere. This threat grows even more significant in regions where magic runs rampant or where portals to the realm of Nyx exist, as unrestrained magical energy often causes more chimeras to appear in a region. As such chaotic magic is inherent to a chimera's being, these monsters often manage to shrug off spells cast against them."

A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it."

He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules.

This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories passing intact from one form to the next.",

High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.",

As many would notice these creatures have short, yet powerful arms and legs. At first glance these limbs appear to be useless but in reality they enable the creatures to support itself when rearing up. Another fascinating feature is that the creature has a specialized organ on its back that is vibrated by air and creates unique sound waves. This auditory organ has a biological effect in the surrounding area. Najarala have beautiful plates on both its neck and tail that will rattle when upset, giving unwelcome creatures an early warning. The plates on its tail can be thrown at its enemies and will explode creating a loud burst of sound like a sonic bomb. This will stun both prey and enemies alike.",
